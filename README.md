Project2 is a final project, submitted for a grade in a data science course. Subsequent coursework has been done since towards completion of a data science certificate, but the sole authorship of this project (as opposed to collaborative projects in more advanced coursework) may be helpful. 

Collaborative final project is another sample project submitted for a final grade in a more advanced statistics course, though it was done in a three-person group. My contribution in this project was on conducting feature selection/cross-validation and model training, whereas the rest of the project was evenly divided between my groupmates. Although this is a group project, its substance reflects course material we all mastered. This project was given a perfect score, for what it's worth.

Work is done in Python primarily using Pandas. I have some experience with R and Stata, though nothing as tangible.
