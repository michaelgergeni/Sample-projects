This is a final project, submitted for a grade in a data science course. Subsequent coursework has been done since towards completion of a data science certificate, but the sole authorship of this project (as opposed to collaborative projects in more advanced coursework) may be helpful. Work is done in Python primarily using Pandas. I have some experience with R and Stata, though nothing as tangible.
